## Today's Notes
- Today I was reminded that Github turns documents into HTML for us. 
- If I hit the "raw" button, it will take me to a page where it is shown in markdown.

## Creating my first Shell Script

- We made a directory called 'Hello'
- Touchfile- Don't create a file with a name that you already have used, or the new file will replace the old one and you will lose the content on the previous file.
