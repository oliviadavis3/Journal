## Thoreau
- "Much is published, little printed"
    - Much is made known, or experienced. However little is written or put into books.
    - Many things can be put into a book, like descriptions of sounds or feelings. However these things must be experienced, using the senses, to truly understand.
    - "The rays which stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the shutter is wholly removed". What's printed in a book is "fixed". It is permanent, however when you are out in the world, attentive to what's around you, it's there but then gone. (Like nature's snapchat, -Schacht)
    - Be attentive to those things that appear for just a second
- Gaining wisdom through experience. "street smarts" vs "book smarts".
    - difference between book learning, and learning by being in the world.
    - Nature has its own language
